Javascript - ECMA

------------------------------------------------------

Browser     -
---------
		Javascript running on browser not allowed to 
		run or manipulate anything outside browser
		
		* You can access browser features and 
		the current document that is running on
		the browser
		
		* you cannot send a mail using mail server
		* you cannot connect with databases
		* you cannot create files
		* you cannot operate on os processes
		* you cannot manipulate and connect with applications
		* you cannot handle most network related functionalites
		
	Hence Javascript was confined only to browser

But With Node Js, We got an alternate platform to 
run javascript

This made Javascript to be used as backend language 
as well

Node JS Can run javascript, it cannot access browser
features

* it can access filesystem
* can handle os and process 
* can handle various network protocals
* can  connect almost all kinds of dbs
* can communicate with mail servers and other softwares
